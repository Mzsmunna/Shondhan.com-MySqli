# Shondhan.com-MySqli
It's a Home or Flat or Land rent / sell  Web Application. I along with my group mates Developed this web project back in 2017 based on  PHP, JavaScript, Ajax, MySQL DB, MySqli API, Bootstrap. 

In this App you can post add along with picture. And others can see those your add and those who are interested can contact with the Owner through the contact number from the ADD Post. Basic CRUD operation of Advertise add, update , delete and search as well as Ajax search is available.

Admin Panel is missing here in this project as I was inspired bt Bikroy.com & thought Admin panel is not that necessary. But now I can realize that I was wrong!

In this Project database will be auto generated. So no sql file is necessary to run the Project. Just Clone/Download the project. Make sure your MySQL is running and you are good to go.
